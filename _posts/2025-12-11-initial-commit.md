Welcome to my new blog. I've set this up to share my knowledge in cybersecurity.

### What to expect

I'll be posting:
* **HackTheBox Writeups**: Walkthroughs of boxes I've pwned.
* **CTF Solutions**: Interesting challenges from various competitions.
* **Security Research**: Things I find interesting in the wild.

Stay tuned.

```python
def pwn_the_world():
    print("Hack the Planet!")

pwn_the_world()
```
